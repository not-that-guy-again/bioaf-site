description: Run Nextflow and Snakemake bioinformatics workflows with real-time monitoring.
---

bioAF includes a built-in pipeline execution engine that lets you run bioinformatics workflows without managing compute infrastructure.

## Pipeline catalog

bioAF ships with pre-configured nf-core pipelines:

- **nf-core/scrnaseq** — Single-cell RNA-seq analysis
- **nf-core/rnaseq** — Bulk RNA-seq quantification
- **nf-core/atacseq** — ATAC-seq peak calling and analysis
- Custom pipelines can be added by providing a Git repository URL

{% include info-bubble.html title="What is nf-core?" content="nf-core is a community effort to collect, curate, and maintain high-quality Nextflow pipelines for bioinformatics. These pipelines are peer-reviewed, well-tested, and follow best practices. bioAF makes them available with one-click launching." %}

## Launching a run

Select a pipeline, choose your experiment and samples, configure any parameter overrides, and launch. bioAF handles:

- Scheduling compute resources
- Staging input data
- Executing the workflow
- Collecting outputs to the results bucket
- Notifying you when it's done

## Real-time monitoring

Every running pipeline shows:

- **Stage-by-stage status** — See which steps are complete, running, or queued
- **DAG visualization** — A visual graph of the workflow structure
- **Resource usage** — CPU, memory, and timing per stage
- **Live logs** — Stream logs from any running stage

## Outputs and results

When a pipeline completes, outputs are automatically:

- Stored in the results bucket
- Linked to the originating experiment and samples
- Available for QC dashboards and visualization
- Recorded in the audit log with full parameter provenance
