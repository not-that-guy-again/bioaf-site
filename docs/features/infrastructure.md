title: Infrastructure Management
description: Enable and disable platform components from the bioAF UI.
---

bioAF lets you manage your cloud infrastructure entirely through the web interface. No need to SSH into servers, edit configuration files, or learn cloud-specific tools.

## Component catalog

The **Component Settings** page shows every available platform component:

- What it does (in plain language)
- Estimated monthly cost
- Current status (enabled, disabled, provisioning)
- Dependencies on other components

## Enabling a component

1. Find the component you want to enable
2. Review the cost estimate
3. Click **Enable**
4. bioAF generates an infrastructure plan and shows you what will be created
5. Review and confirm
6. Watch the provisioning progress in real time

{% include info-bubble.html title="What's an infrastructure plan?" content="When you enable a component, bioAF creates a plan describing exactly what cloud resources it needs to create — servers, databases, storage, networking rules. You see this plan before anything is created, including cost estimates. This uses a technology called Terraform, which is an industry-standard tool for managing cloud infrastructure safely and predictably." %}

## Disabling a component

Disable any optional component to remove its cloud resources and stop incurring costs. Core components (database, storage) cannot be disabled while the platform is running.

## GitOps

Every infrastructure change is version-controlled. This means:

- You can see the full history of what was provisioned and when
- You can roll back to a previous configuration
- All changes are auditable

{% include info-bubble.html title="What is GitOps?" content="GitOps means using version control (like a detailed change history) to manage infrastructure. Every time bioAF changes your cloud resources, it records exactly what changed and why. Think of it like track changes in a Word document, but for your infrastructure." %}

## Upgrades

bioAF checks for new versions automatically. When an update is available:

1. You'll see a notification in the UI
2. Review what changed in the new version
3. Click **Upgrade** to pull the update, rebuild, and migrate
4. If anything goes wrong, roll back with one click
