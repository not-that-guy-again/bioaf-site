bioAF includes a built-in cost center that gives you visibility into your Google Cloud spending without needing to navigate the GCP console.

## Spending dashboard

The Cost Center shows:

- **Total spend** for the current billing period
- **Per-component breakdown** — compute, storage, database, networking
- **Per-project costs** — see which experiments or projects are driving spend
- **Trend charts** — spending over time with projections
- **Budget status** — visual indicator of how close you are to your threshold

## Budget alerts

Set a monthly spending threshold and get notified when you approach it:

1. Navigate to **Admin > Cost Center > Budgets**
2. Set your monthly threshold
3. Choose notification channels (email, Slack, in-app)

Alerts fire at 50%, 80%, and 100% of your budget.

## Cost optimization

The Cost Center also highlights opportunities to reduce spending:

- Idle notebook sessions that could be stopped
- Components that are provisioned but unused
- Storage tiers with data that could be archived

This is the same data Google uses to generate your invoice — bioAF just organizes it by platform component so you can see what's driving costs at a glance." %}
