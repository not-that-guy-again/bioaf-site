bioAF provides centralized data management with automatic organization and lifecycle policies.

## File browser

The **Data & Files** section gives you a unified view of all data on the platform:

- Browse by experiment, project, or file type
- See file metadata (size, upload date, source)
- Upload new files via drag-and-drop
- Download files individually or in bulk

## Data lifecycle

bioAF organizes data across four storage tiers that map to the research workflow:

| Tier | Purpose | Retention |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Ingest** | Incoming files from sequencer or upload | Moved to Raw after processing |
| **Raw** | Original FASTQ files, untouched | Permanent |
| **Working** | Intermediate pipeline outputs | 30 days (configurable) |
| **Results** | Final outputs (h5ad, plots, QC reports) | Permanent |

{% include info-bubble.html title="Where is my data stored?" content="All data is stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets in your own GCP project. You have full ownership and access — bioAF organizes and manages the data but never moves it outside your project." %}

## Auto-ingest

If your sequencing core or instrument is on the same network, bioAF can automatically detect and import new FASTQ files as they're produced. This uses Google Cloud Pub/Sub to watch for new files and trigger the import pipeline.

## Dataset browser

The **Datasets** view provides a higher-level view of your data organized by experiment and analysis stage, making it easy to find specific results without navigating the raw file tree.
