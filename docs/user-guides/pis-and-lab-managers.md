title: Guide for PIs & Lab Managers
description: How to track team progress, monitor costs, and manage your bioAF platform.
---

This guide covers what PIs, lab managers, and team leads need from bioAF — visibility into team activity, cost oversight, and audit compliance.

## The dashboard

Your first stop is the **Dashboard**. It shows:

- Active pipeline runs and their progress
- Running notebook sessions
- Recent team activity
- Quick links to experiments and results

<!-- TODO: Screenshot of dashboard -->
<div class="screenshot">Screenshot: Dashboard showing active runs, sessions, and recent activity feed</div>

## Tracking team activity

The **Activity Feed** (accessible from the dashboard or the sidebar) shows a chronological stream of everything happening on the platform:

- Experiments created and updated
- Pipelines launched and completed
- Samples added and data uploaded
- Status changes and reviews

You can filter by team member, experiment, or date range.

## Monitoring costs

### The Cost Center

Navigate to **Admin > Cost Center** for a complete view of your cloud spending:

- **Total spend** this billing period
- **Per-component breakdown** — see exactly what's driving costs (compute, storage, database, etc.)
- **Per-project costs** — track spending by experiment or project
- **Trend charts** — spending over time with projections
- **Budget status** — how close you are to your set threshold

<!-- TODO: Screenshot of cost center dashboard -->
<div class="screenshot">Screenshot: Cost Center showing spending breakdown by component, trend chart, and budget indicator</div>

### Setting budget alerts

1. Go to **Admin > Cost Center > Budgets**
2. Set a monthly budget threshold
3. Choose notification channels (email, Slack, in-app)
4. bioAF alerts you when spending reaches 50%, 80%, and 100% of your budget

{% include info-bubble.html title="Where do these costs come from?" content="bioAF runs on your Google Cloud project. The costs shown in the Cost Center are pulled directly from your GCP billing data — they're the same numbers you'd see in the Google Cloud console, but organized by bioAF component so you can see what's driving spend." %}

## Using the audit log

The **Audit Log** provides an immutable record of every action taken on the platform. This is critical for:

- **Publication provenance** — trace any result back to the exact experiment, samples, pipeline version, and parameters that produced it
- **Regulatory compliance** — demonstrate a complete chain of custody for your data
- **Troubleshooting** — see exactly what happened and when

<!-- TODO: Screenshot of audit log -->
<div class="screenshot">Screenshot: Audit log showing filterable list of events with user, action, resource, and timestamp</div>

Each audit entry includes:
- Who performed the action
- What they did (in plain language)
- Which resource was affected
- When it happened
- Additional context (parameter changes, status transitions, etc.)

You can filter by user, action type, resource, or date range, and export the log for external reporting.

## Managing users and roles

### Adding users

Navigate to **Admin > Users** and click **Add User**. Assign one of the built-in roles or a custom role.

### Built-in roles

| Role | Access level |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full platform access including user management, component provisioning, and settings |
| **Computational Biologist** | Run pipelines, launch notebooks, manage environments, full data access |
| **Scientist** | Register experiments, add samples, upload data, view results |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to experiments, results, and files |

### Custom roles

For more granular control, create custom roles under **Admin > Roles**. You can grant or deny access per resource type and action (create, read, update, delete).

## Reviewing results

You don't need to run pipelines yourself to review the output. From any experiment:

- Open **QC dashboards** to check sequencing quality
- Launch **cellxgene** to explore single-cell embeddings interactively
- Browse the **plot archive** for publication-ready figures
- Download reports for offline review or sharing
